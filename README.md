# Deep Neural Network for Bermudan Option Pricing

An applied research project on Bermudan option pricing using Feed-Forward Neural Networks to approach the conditional expectations in the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm. It is based on the original publication *Neural network regression for Bermudan
option pricing* (2021) by Bernard Lapeyre and Jérôme Lelong, and includes Python based numerical outputs using `tensorflow` and `sklearn`.
